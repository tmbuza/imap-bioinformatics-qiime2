   abstract = {BACKGROUND: As microbial ecologists take advantage of high-throughput sequencing technologies to describe microbial communities across ever-increasing numbers of samples, new analysis tools are required to relate the distribution of microbes among larger numbers of communities, and to use increasingly rich and standards-compliant metadata to understand the biological factors driving these relationships. In particular, the Earth Microbiome Project drives these needs by profiling the genomic content of tens of thousands of samples across multiple environment types. FINDINGS: Features of EMPeror include: ability to visualize gradients and categorical data, visualize different principal coordinates axes, present the data in the form of parallel coordinates, show taxa as well as environmental samples, dynamically adjust the size and transparency of the spheres representing the communities on a per-category basis, dynamically scale the axes according to the fraction of variance each explains, show, hide or recolor points according to arbitrary metadata including that compliant with the MIxS family of standards developed by the Genomic Standards Consortium, display jackknifed-resampled data to assess statistical confidence in clustering, perform coordinate comparisons (useful for procrustes analysis plots), and greatly reduce loading times and overall memory footprint compared with existing approaches. Additionally, ease of sharing, given EMPeror's small output file size, enables agile collaboration by allowing users to embed these visualizations via emails or web pages without the need for extra plugins. CONCLUSIONS: Here we present EMPeror, an open source and web browser enabled tool with a versatile command line interface that allows researchers to perform rapid exploratory investigations of 3D visualizations of microbial community data, such as the widely used principal coordinates plots. EMPeror includes a rich set of controllers to modify features as a function of the metadata. By being specifically tailored to the requirements of microbial ecologists, EMPeror thus increases the speed with which insight can be gained from large microbiome datasets.},

@article{Dadasnake2021,
   abstract = {Background: Amplicon sequencing of phylogenetic marker genes, e.g., 16S, 18S, or ITS ribosomal RNA sequences, is still the most commonly used method to determine the composition of microbial communities. Microbial ecologists often have expert knowledge on their biological question and data analysis in general, and most research institutes have computational infrastructures to use the bioinformatics command line tools and workflows for amplicon sequencing analysis, but requirements of bioinformatics skills often limit the efficient and up-to-date use of computational resources. Results: We present dadasnake, a user-friendly, 1-command Snakemake pipeline that wraps the preprocessing of sequencing reads and the delineation of exact sequence variants by using the favorably benchmarked and widely used DADA2 algorithm with a taxonomic classification and the post-processing of the resultant tables, including hand-off in standard formats. The suitability of the provided default configurations is demonstrated using mock community data from bacteria and archaea, as well as fungi. Conclusions: By use of Snakemake, dadasnake makes efficient use of high-performance computing infrastructures. Easy user configuration guarantees flexibility of all steps, including the processing of data from multiple sequencing platforms. It is easy to install dadasnake via conda environments. dadasnake is available at https://github.com/a-h-b/dadasnake.},

   abstract = {Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way. Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},
