## Classification methods

### 1. De novo clustering
Sequences are clustered against one another.

### Closed-reference clustering
Here the clustering is performed at 99% identity against the Greengenes reference database.

### Open-reference clustering
Here the clustering is performed at 99% identity against the Greengenes reference database.

## Alignment of representative sequences
- The MAFFT (Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform) software provides alignments of the representative sequences.
- Then we will run alignment mask function to remove poor alignments.

## Quality control and feature table with DADA2
QIIME2 uses DADA2 [@DADA22016] tool for:

- Detecting poor reads in Illumina amplicon sequence data.
- Denoising.
- Filtering chimeric sequences.
- Filtering any phiX reads present in marker gene.
- Construction of feature table.
